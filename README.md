Meteor + Cordova + appcache: online and offline
===============================================

This is example Cordova project which injects Meteor application into Cordova's index.html. Application is stored in appcache and can be executed even if your mobile device is offline.

Usage
-----

Add **appcache** package to your meteor application:

	meteor add appcache

Add [fusion](https://github.com/usefulio/meteor-fusion) package to your meteor application:

	mrt add fusion

This will add server side route to your application: "your_app_url/fusion"

Deploy your application somewhere, for example:

	meteor deploy your_app.meteor.com

Add "meteor-cordova-fusion.js" to your cordova project (usually to "www/js/" directory)

Edit your cordova "www/index.html"

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	    <head>
	        <title>Hello World</title>

			<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="js/meteor-cordova-fusion.js"></script>

			<script>
				// change this - put your application URL
				startFusion("http://192.168.1.159:3000");
			</script>

	    </head>

		<body>
			<p>Loading, please wait...</p>
		</body>
	</html>


Change your meteor application URL (e.g. `your_app.meteor.com`)

Build and run your cordova project while device is online. Now turn off your device internet connection and start application again - voil√†: It works!

How it works?
-------------

When you start application in your mobile device, startFusion fires and:

- If device is online: fusion script is loaded from server, stored into localStorage and executed.

- If device is offline: fusion script is loaded from localStorage and executed.

Fusion script will load your meteor application files. They are cached, so will be loaded from HTML5 appcache.

If you change your meteor application at server, your fusion script will change, and next execution when device is online will fetch new fusion script (and new meteor app files) from server.


Device Ready?
-------------

Note that meteor is loaded before cordova js API. When cordova "deviceready" event fires, meteor session variable "DEVICE_READY" will be set to true. 
You should check if DEVICE_READY is set to true before you start using any of cordova API calls in your meteor application.

Also, you can do:

	Deps.autorun(function() {
		if(Session.get("DEVICE_READY")) {
			// do something when device is ready (when cordova API is loaded and initialized)
		}
	});

That's it :)
